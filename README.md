## Project Overview

### Background

Having observed the reliance of immigrant-owned businesses on traditional advertising methods, I initiated the development of a digital solution to complement and enhance the existing marketing strategies of my aunt's restaurant.

### Goals

The primary goal was to create a functional, visually appealing website that:
- Improves the online visibility of Pho Voorhees.
- Simplifies the ordering process for both customers and staff.
- Adapts to the diverse linguistic needs of the restaurant's clientele.

## Development Process

### Analysis

I started by analyzing leading restaurant websites to identify industry standards and common pitfalls. This informed the strategic direction for the website's feature set and user interface.

### Implementation

Key implementations include:
- **Filtered Menu:** Developed using JavaScript and AJAX for real-time user interaction without page reloads.
- **Font Support:** Selection of Unicode-compliant fonts to support Vietnamese characters, ensuring legibility and accessibility.
- **Online Ordering System:** Integration with the existing POS system via APIs to automate the ordering cycle from online interface to kitchen.

### Challenges

One significant challenge was the real-time synchronization of the online orders with the on-site POS system, which required custom backend solutions to ensure reliability during peak hours.

## Conclusion

The Pho Voorhees website has significantly impacted the restaurantâ€™s operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. It serves as a testament to the power of digital solutions in modernizing traditional businesses.
